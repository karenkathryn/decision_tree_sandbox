# Decision Tree Sandbox
This is a repository for experimenting with decision trees. This README.md file will serve as a roadmap to this repository. The repository is open and available to the public.

## Directories and files to be aware of:
* A data/ directory that houses the raw and processed data used in this project. Due to Github upload limits, the data will be housed on a local machine and are stored as .gitignore files.
* An src/ directory that contains any .py modules needed for this exploration.
* A notebooks/ directory that houses Jupyter Notebooks.
* A results/ directory that houses image files.

## Data
The data can be downloaded from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris/data?select=database.sqlite). An account set-up is required for download. The data is a SQLite database containing the same data as Iris.csv
